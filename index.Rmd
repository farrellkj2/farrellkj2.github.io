My name is Kait (she/her), and I am an ecologist and educator. 

I am currently a lecturer in the [Odum School of Ecology](http://ecology.uga.edu/) at the [University of Georgia](https://uga.edu/) where I develop and teach courses that train students in data literacy through the lens of ecological principles and practices. From 2019-2023, I worked as the undergraduate ecology lab coordinator for the Odum School of Ecology. As lab coordinator, I developed hands-on lab activities to engage both science majors and non-majors with ecological concepts and skills. You can learn more about the courses I teach and coordinate by visiting the [Teaching](https://farrellkj2.github.io/teaching.html) tab.

I also serve as the UGA Director of Domestic Field Study. [Domestic Field Study (DFS)](https://dfs.uga.edu/) programs integrate place-based, active, and experiential learning through site-specific learning opportunities throughout the United States. These faculty-led, course-based programs provide immersive, off-campus learning experiences for students across UGA. As the Director, I support current program directors and facilitate the development of new study away programs within the US to expand opportunities for UGA students to engage deeply with place-based learning. 



My research background is in freshwater ecosystem ecology. I earned my Ph.D. in Ecology in May 2017 from the University of Georgia, and from 2017-2019, I was a postdoctoral associate at Virginia Tech, where I worked on lake modeling and developing teaching modules to bring "big data" concepts into undergraduate ecology classes.
